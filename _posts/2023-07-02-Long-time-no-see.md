Friends come by often, but rarely do you get a chance to find a good person who you can call family, a friendship beyond the bounds of blood, kinship, and brotherhood. Individuals at random often do provide a profound impact on our mindset and perceptions, which may be constructive or destructive, but at the end, another overview for you, a fresh image to understand and work with.

Although few people are ideally great, I have a rather pessimistic view that true friendships are those where people are there for you always, not where people have been there for years and decades.

Food for thought: Would you rather open up to a stranger about your past and not ask anything in return, Or Will you rather know everything about them even before you open up?
