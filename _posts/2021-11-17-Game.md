So where do I begin?
Never have I been athletic in my life. When it came to sports, I really couldn't do much because of my poor reflexes. People used to make fun because I would be this usual fat kid who moves like a sumo wrestler. It’s just that one day I kept trying to kick a goal, shoot a basket, random moves that I created and luck is what let me play with people better than me. 

>I grew up watching my brother and others play the game and thought they sucked till i tried. To think a day would come where I would have to say goodbye to this game is like a heartbreak. Even though i sucked at certain aspects of my game mentality. It was my go too stress buster, but the same led to my deteriorating mobility. 

My best ability was to copy moves and adjust them to my motion, a basic copycat from childhood.
I wouldn't know if I will ever get back again with the same mindset to play after going through so much but surely will watch it from afar. This blog, my painting, book reading, casual gaming and what not has replaced the urge to go back towards the game mentally.

Hope that even though if I come to play I wouldn’t be the foolish, careless old self I was four years ago.


Also! I didn't suck, i just didn't play at a 100% ;)

Alvida.......
