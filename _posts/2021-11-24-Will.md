Having a built/big figure doesn't mean your strong.
Late realization but yeah, have always been the weakling without knowing my strengths since childhood. Be it sports or academics, all my skills came solely through my practise.

My tall figure never enabled me. People tell a lot about wishing to be as tall as me.
To them I say, you will never know your potential if you can't even play your cards right, be small, short, tall, skinny or fat. You won’t know what’s your highest level of efficiency without even trying to be the best.

Just enjoy being you. Don't try to fit your foot inside another shoe, you will get shoe bites :D

My two cents:
Padayappa of Munnar, Indrajeet. These are nothing but your ordinary big mammals that are also weak to us in present. But at a point in time, we feared them since we couldn't control them. Even those they look big and strong, they are brute yet humble, feared yet worshipped. People suggest to be strong and brave as them, doesn't mean your physique ;).
