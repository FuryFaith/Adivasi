## What am I?

Am I just a construct, a thing of your subconsciousness or a vague thought that arose spontaneously?
Things we tend to think about ourselves arise when we feel insecure, that's unavoidable!
But is it bad to have this dark mind set even when you feel like you are supposed to be a gentleman of our time? Canâ€™t I just have an imagination where things go my way, just a secluded world apart from reality. Can it be that my two face is just another me waiting to shift place? Will I break my mirror to avoid this me or will i embrace the dark?

> I plan to figure out what this darkness brings out, things i usually won't even bother to do or think about. Would it bring out spontaneous and outright thoughts? but why bother to change what I haven't done in decades. Is this the rebel phase my comrades? A change in pace, my train of thoughts seem to be better than the old me.
