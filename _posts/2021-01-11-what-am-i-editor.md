<h2>What am i?</h2>
Am i just a construct, a thing of your subconciousness or a vauge thought that arose spontenously?
Things we tend to think about ourselves arise when we feel insecure, that's unavoidable!.
But is it bad to have this darkmind set even when your feel like you are supposed to be a gentleman of our time.
Can't i just have an imagination where things go my way, just a seculded world apart from reality.
Can it be that my two face is just another me waiting to shift place?
Will i break my mirror to avoid this me or will i embrace the dark?
To be continued.....
