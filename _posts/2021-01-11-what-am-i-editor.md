## What am I?

Am I just a construct, a thing of your subconsciousness or a vague thought that arose spontaneously?
Things we tend to think about ourselves arise when we feel insecure; that's unavoidable!
But is it bad to have this dark mindset even when you feel like you are supposed to be a gentleman of our time? Can’t I just have an imagination where things go my way, just a secluded world apart from reality? Can it be that my two faces are just another me waiting to shift place? Will I break my mirror to avoid this me, or will I embrace the dark?

> I plan to figure out what this darkness brings out, things I usually won't even bother to do or think about. Would it bring out spontaneous and outright thoughts? But why bother to change what I haven't done in decades? Is this the rebel phase, my comrades? A change in pace, my train of thoughts seem to be better than the old me.
