As months and years passed since I wrote my last blog, I realised that people adapt to the environment, although some deny that it won't bring any change. But this adaptability does happen even at a microscopic level as people tend to offset the new change brought about by our surroundings - be it people, the work, the place or the culture.

Although certain things hold a person from everchanging nature of time and environment, it's the learning to let things go that is the hardest. Sometimes, your negatives are put forward as resistance towards such conversion.
