As months and years passed by since i wrote my last blog, i realised that people do adapt to enivironment, although some do deny that it won't bring any change. But this adaptability does happen even at an microsopic level as people tend to offset the new change brought about by our surrondings - be it may people, the work, the place or the culture.
