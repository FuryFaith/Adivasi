## Man of Steel
We think we are made of steel, yet this is my proof that even steel can break. Usually, we tend to walk on depression if something bad happens in our life. Imagine now being healthy and suddenly in need of a support to do your basic routine, sounds depressing? Well, that’s the loop I am stuck for the next few months. I have had this happen once before, but thinking about that now feels obsolete. People tend to judge things before and after as always. This crack in my armour feels bad but they seem to care less about that and more on how it happened, even then am I to blame?

Anyways, I felt that this crack has changed my lifestyle and thought process. I don't see this as a flaw, there are people with same crack and chinks on their armour, performing the wildest things with confidence, winning even against the odds. So why can't I?

Find new ways to achieve your goals, let it be that the first road seems blur, traverse through another path you can define. Replace old habits that got you there in that state, with something that you have been wanting to do in a long while, which is still doable if your mind and body can handle. Let me share my two cents now:

>`Kintsugi`, It's a `Japanese art form` for repairing broken household items by using lacquer and golden filaments, that highlights the history of that item, embracing the flaw rather than disguising it. In my case it’s a medical procedure that occurred.

## Don't feel ashamed to be flawed 
Don't stress yourself about being perfect, cause even that broken `bowl` works same as a new one would, just appears different.
