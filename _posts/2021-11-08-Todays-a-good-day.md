## Hello World!
Today, `Eight November`, Twenty-Third day since my fix. 
I have been finding it difficult to do anything without depending on my family, especially my `mom` and my `brother`. Things that anybody would find silly is what I would need help in the most and they supported me no matter what.

I am proud to say that I was able to achieve a lot in these 3 weeks, can walk without my support i.e., `Walker` my comrades (not Luke Sky Walker), but not for long and not without a limp. My regular routine of exercises has made me able to do upper body exercises like a breeze, things I couldn't even do before the incident. 

Even though I can't meet any other souls yet and hang around, I just want to point out that thanks to all who supported me till here and staying by my side. It really meant a lot. I know itâ€™s too early to say since there is still more to achieve still but this really felt like a lot of stuff to do in weeks.

Miss my `friends` the most in this time, as I can't get out until my final clearance, which is in another 8 weeks from the doctor. But I promise ill meet all of you as much as I can.

Good day and then until next time .......

Best regards.
