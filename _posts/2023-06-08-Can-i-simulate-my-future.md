## Future Sim

Do repeated tasks bring a Profound improvement in an individual or does it just make a person lazy as they get mentally stuck at performing the task in one way, i.e., their way. Does it make Sheldon from the famous television show Big Bang Theory a genius or a docile person who found an easy way to perform tasks?

My thought is that, no matter what I perform or achieve now, would that amount define what I would be in the coming future?

Currently being stuck in a never-ending loop of repeated tasks just gave me more skills on how to tackle a task that occurs at a frequency based on my memory retention, or did it make me a trained circus animal that just knows how to perform tricks based on a lucrative reward system? Am I the captain of this ship or just the prisoner of current time in my delusion world?

It makes me question whether geniuses also feel the same. I get it that solving a task in a short, easy, simple one-way action reduces any time taken to perform the task and any errors that arise due to the same. But it is dumb not to find new alternative ways to perform the same task if even we could improve upon the work or action performed.

But my peers and even my siblings, related or not, always support me and always tend to provide me new perspectives on life. When I went to them with this question in mind, they first thought how serious I was while stating this question. But what I learned from these bright minds is that in life no matter what I put myself through, be that may experiences from project work in my office or academics or even day to day routine it's up to how then my opportunities arise and how I choose my path based on current data and also on my ability and confidence.

I now am certain that whatever I choose, it’s up to me to either pick it up or drop it, benefit from it, love the process and not regret after all the work is done.

Thanks, Y’all, `I Love you 3000`.
