This Blog is about my travel journey & life pictured.
In a nutshell, it’s just another journal for a stranger to read :) with pictures, of course!
Hope that my writings and thoughts be pleasing, if not funny, to the wandering minds.

> Hi, I am Aravind, Dil se Adi (Adi by Heart), just an average Joe who is in all means a panda, lazy yet efficient. My key interests are life coding, blogging and bragging ;) ha-ha. Would love to have chats with interesting people and always get to learn and understand new perspectives.

**Yours’s Sincerely**
Adi.
