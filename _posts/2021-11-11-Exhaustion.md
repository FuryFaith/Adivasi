It's been six days, I feel the monotonous robot in me is just living to eat, sleep, work & repeat. There is no faint silver lining on the other side of work or life. Slugging since my graduation. It isn't new to anyone cause to level up your knowledge, the learning process takes time and energy.

My schedule hasn't been ever great, to be honest, but I find that following a routine helps me out to declutter this madness going on always. Wise man, aka my dad, always had this concept

> No matter what chaos takes over your life, this discipline might give you a sense of control. But works only if you dedicated towards the routine."

I find this interesting as I had tried this, and it helped me to sort out some of my clashes with time and studies in my early part of college.

So my two cents from the Japanese`(basically their Yen)` and Virat Kohli `(Yup him too)`,
Also, it is okay not to follow it regularly but just try it at least once.

### Bushido

The samurai of ancient Japan followed a sequence of rules called the `Bushido` or “The Way of the Warrior”. These philosophical codes and guiding principles were specifically for the samurai warriors.

<h5>Gi – Justice or Integrity</h5>
This is ensuring that the individual has the right way and mindset when making decisions – that they have the power to decide swiftly. It is to guarantee that the person avoids indecisiveness and that decisions are based on the proper reasons.

<h5>Yu – Courage</h5>
Yu is focused on ensuring that an individual does and dares to do the right thing, not what others expect them to do. If a person is raised particularly, they have their own beliefs that they follow and dare to do.

<h5>Jin – Mercy or Benevolence</h5>
As great warriors, samurai have the right power to kill; yet due to the Bushido, Jin is to ensure that their mind and thinking is balanced – having mercy and sympathy at the proper situation.

<h5>Jin and the Samurai</h5>
This is to ensure that the warrior fought for the right reason and belief; it is also to guarantee that if there was no need to kill, the samurai would have mercy.

<h5>Rei – Respect</h5>
Based on the belief of a samurai, it is important that they respect and be polite towards everything. Their way of life meant they should be respectful of elders, respect life, and respect the beliefs of others.

<h5>Makoto – Honesty</h5>
Honesty was always vital since the warriors believed that honesty in everything they did would acquire respect. It would also mean that they are trustworthy.

<h5>Meiyo – Honor</h5>
Living and dying with great honor was vital to every samurai warrior. Everything they did was with great honor, meaning everything that they did based on their belief was with honor.

<h5>Chugi – Loyalty</h5>
Another vital aspect of the Bushido was loyalty. The samurai treated each other just like family and would safeguard and help their fellow warriors.

This was important because it meant they could trust each other, knowing that they would be loyal despite the circumstances.
